- **[TxAllo: Dynamic Transaction Allocation in Sharded Blockchain Systems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10184617/)** at the 39th IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE 2023, CORE ranking-A*)

  - This work investigated the transaction and account allocation problem in
sharded blockchains to reduce the expensive cross-shard transactions. We formulated and converted this problem and key concepts from the blockchain
domain to the graph domain and proposed a community detection algorithm, TxAllo, to
optimize the throughput on this graph. TxAllo simultaneously considered the number of cross-shard transactions and the workload balance among shards. The experiments illustrate that the ratio of cross-shard transactions can be significantly
reduced from about 98% to 12%. In the meantime, the workload
balance is also well maintained in different shards. For the
adaptive updating method A-TxAllo, the execution time is approximately
800 times faster.


- **[Correlation-aware Next Basket Recommendation using Graph Attention Networks](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-63820-7_85)** at the 27th International Conference on Neural Information Processing (ICONIP2020, CORE ranking-A)

  - This work investigated the next basket recommendation task and proposed the first end-to-end correlation-aware model to predict the next basket considering intra-basket correlations using graph attention networks. By estimating and aggregating the intra-basket correlations using the attention layer of the self-attention model, the recommendation can be conducted at the basket level, instead of at the item level.


- **[FCP Filter: A Dynamic Clustering-Prediction Framework for Customer Behavior](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-47426-3_45)** at the 24th Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (PAKDD 2020, CORE ranking-A)

  - **Yuanzhe Zhang**, Ling Luo, Yang Wang, Zhiyong Wang.

  - Customer purchase behaviour prediction is often limited by the randomness of individual historic transaction data. In the meanwhile, Fragmentation and Coagulation Process (FCP), as a SOTA stochastic customer partition model, does not support forecasting purchase behaviour as such a data-driven method requires transaction observations to conduct clustering. To tackle this challenge, this work proposed FCP filter, a clustering-prediction framework based on FCP. FCP filter utilizes FCP to cluster customers into groups by their temporal interests to filter the individual random noise. A predictor is then built on grouped data and the predicted results are fed to FCP as the prior knowledge at the next time step. We demonstrated that FCP filter can discover a flexible number of latent groups and provide accurate predictions for dynamic purchase behaviour.
